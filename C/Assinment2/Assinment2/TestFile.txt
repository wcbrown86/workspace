The current iPhone lineup consists of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. While there are three devices, you’re rather limited in your choices. Want an OLED display? 
The iPhone X is your only option. Want Face ID? The iPhone X is your sole choice. Want a budget price? The iPhone 8 – and its age-old design – is your only pick.

Much of that changes this year. All three of the new iPhones will sport Face ID, two of them will sport an OLED display. The 6.1-inch LCD model will cater towards the lower-end 
of the market and feature an iPhone X-like design.

In addition to the added variety, the introduction of new iPhones also means the current models will become cheaper. Reports have suggested that the 2018 iPhone X refresh will 
drop the entry-level price to $899, with the iPhone X Plus coming in at the $999 price point.

Thus, this means the current-gen, 2017 iPhone X will also get cheaper. While it’s unclear at this point how, or if, Apple will sell the 2017 iPhone X once it introduces the 
new 2018 models, carriers and retailers will undoubtedly have excess inventory they’re looking to get rid of. If the new 2018 iPhone X does indeed start at $899, we will 
likely see the 2017 model going for below $800 through retailers and carriers.
