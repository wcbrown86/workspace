In this repository I keep most of my work from school, and any work that I have done in personal study.
Most of this work is not complete, or refined. As this work is completed and refined it is removed from
this repository and added to the profolio repository. 

Any school work will contain the file with the requirements from the instructor. Any other work will not.
This work should contain a comment at the top of the main file that will outline the purpose of the program.
